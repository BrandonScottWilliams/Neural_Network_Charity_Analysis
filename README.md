# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
The purpose of the analysis is to  predict where Alphabet soup should be making investments. This is achieved using binary classifiers that are capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.
## Results
* The vaiable IS_SUCCESSFUL is the target of the model
* The columns APPLICATION_TYPE, AFFILIATION, CLASSIFICATION, USE_CASE, ORGANIZATION, STATUS, INCOME_AMT, SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS, ASK_AMT are features.
* The columns EIN and NAME are not features of our model.
* There were 110 neurons selected for the neural network model
* There were 2 hidden layers selected for the neural network model
* There were 2 activation functions selected forthe neural network model
* We were unable too reach the target performance of 75%
* To increase the performance of the model we used bucketting, added more neurons to a hidden layer and tried a different activation function.
## Summary
The neural network was unable to reach the target.
